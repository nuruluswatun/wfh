		<h3>
		<p>This is UIN's old library, since I entered campus in 2018, this library has not been used for a long time.</p>
		<p>And next to it is the new library Uin and I am very comfortable spending time there.</p>
		<p>Maybe some people don't like this place, because it is often considered a place for nerds </p>
		<p>and it is very boring to spend time here. but for me, this place is the most comfortable place in uin.</p>
		<p>because there is air conditioning that makes the room cool, complete books, fast internet access </p>
		<p>and also a prayer room so that when the call to prayer we can immediately pray in this library </p>
		<p>without looking for the nearest mosque first.</p>

		<p>In the past, my daily activities were lectures and assignments.</p>
		<p>now, I am like a housewife who does not have a husband. </p>
